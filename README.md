# python-api-challenge

In this challenge, I managed to figure everything out with the exception of the line equation positioning,  scatter plot graph dimensions, and the define function. For some reason the height of some of the graphs extends further below the data and still doesn’t reveal the line equation. For the define function, I wasn’t able to locate a similar regression activity from day 3, even though I remember going over def in class. 

** Analysis **

The linear regression on the Northern Hemisphere’s max temperatures yields a strong correlation with a downward slope. As the latitude increases the max temperature decreases, so there is a strong negative correlation.

The linear regression on the Southern Hemisphere’s max temperatures yields a moderate correlation with an upward slope. As the latitude increases the max temperature also increases supporting a moderate positive correlation.

The linear regression of Humidity in the Northern Hemisphere yields a very weak positive correlation

The linear regression of Humidity in the Southern Hemisphere also yields a very weak positive correlation

The linear regression of Cloudiness in the Northern Hemisphere yields a very weak positive correlation

The linear regression of Cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere also yields a very weak positive correlation

The linear regression of Wind Speed in the Northern Hemisphere yields a very weak positive correlation

The linear regression of Wind Speed in the Southern Hemisphere yields a very weak negative correlation
